When draw and erase are not virtual functions and center is called, figures
version of draw and erase are called.  When they are virtual however
polymorphism comes into effect and triangles version is called when it
is a triangle object calling center and rectangles version is called
when it is a rectangle calling the object.

This works because virtual causes a runtime type check to be invoked
so the correct version of the method is called.
